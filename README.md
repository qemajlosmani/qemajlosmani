### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer from Kosovo. Since January, 2020 I've been living in Germany and working as a Software and System Developer.
I work on code that helps people be more efficient and effective in their work, whether itâ€™s by automating aspects of their job or giving them new insights into their data.
Iâ€™ve been working in software development for more than 10 years now, and Iâ€™ve found that itâ€™s a field where I can constantly learn new things and apply my existing skills in new ways.
