### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a software developer originally from Kosovo who has resided in Germany since January 2020, where I am employed as a Software and System Developer.
My focus lies in creating code that enhances individuals' efficiency and effectiveness in their professional endeavors.
This involves tasks such as automating aspects of their responsibilities or providing valuable insights from data analysis.
With over a decade of experience in software development, I find this field continually stimulating, allowing me to acquire new knowledge and apply my existing skills in innovative ways.
